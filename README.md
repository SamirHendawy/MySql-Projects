### Projects List

#### 1. [Instagram Clone Project](https://github.com/SamirHendawy/MySql-Projects/tree/main/Instagram%20Clone%20Project)
A complex MySQL project mimicking an Instagram database to perform deep data analysis. It addresses real-world business scenarios and technical challenges.

**Key Analysis Performed:**
* **User Engagement:** Finding the oldest users and identifying the most popular registration days.
* **Inactive User Tracking:** Identifying users who have never posted or commented.
* **Bot Detection:** Identifying accounts that liked every single photo (potential bots).
* **Advanced Metrics:** Using **CTEs** and subqueries to calculate engagement percentages.

#### 2. [RetailDB Analysis (Advanced & Expert)](https://github.com/SamirHendawy/MySql-Projects/tree/main/SQLRetailDBQueries)
A comprehensive deep-dive into E-commerce data using a multi-table schema. This project focuses on business intelligence, revenue reporting, and advanced retrieval techniques.

**Key Technical Challenges:**
* **Advanced Subqueries:** Utilizing **Nested Subqueries** in the `WHERE` clause and using `WHERE EXISTS` to filter customer order history effectively.
* **Ranking & Window Functions:** Implementing `RANK() OVER()` to identify specific product price tiers without using traditional `LIMIT` clauses.
* **Revenue Analytics:** Calculating total spending per customer and total shipping value using complex aggregations.
* **Data Handling:** Using `COALESCE` to manage `NULL` values in financial reports and performing 4-way table joins (Customers -> Orders -> Details -> Products).

#### 3. [Simple Task](https://github.com/SamirHendawy/MySql-Projects/tree/main/simple%20task)
A practical collection of SQL queries designed to handle fundamental data requests and database operations.
* **Content:** Includes the complete Dataset and a solution script.
* **Scope:** Contains **20 solved queries** covering filtering, aggregations, table joins, and grouping logic.
